## 🛠 How to Make a Game Like This

### 1. Setup HTML5 Canvas
Create an HTML page with a `<canvas>` element for rendering the game.

### 2. Style the Canvas
Center it on the screen with CSS and add a border or background.

### 3. Load Assets
Use `Image()` in JavaScript to load character sprites and backgrounds.

### 4. Implement Game Physics
Add gravity, flap velocity, and simple collision detection for the bird.

### 5. Add Pipes and Scoring
Create vertical obstacles (pipes) and increase score on each pass.

### 6. Handle Game State
Track `gameStarted`, `gameOver`, and reset when the player restarts.

### 7. Store Best Score
Use `localStorage` to remember the highest score between sessions.

### 8. Add Input Support
Use event listeners for keyboard, mouse, and touch to trigger flaps.
